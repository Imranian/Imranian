I'm a mechanical engineer who is passionate about Data Engineering. So, after my graduation, I started learning about Data Science. I've explored areas such as data analytics, business intelligence, and the role of a Data Scientist, among others. Extracting insights from data has been a source of enjoyment for me. However, a question has persistently lingered in my mind: How does the data reach this stage? This curiosity has significantly fueled my interest in the field of data engineering.
